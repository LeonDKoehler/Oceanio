Thank you for trying out my game Oceanio. The game is designed to give you a better understanding about current, human-made impacts on our oceans and how you can reduce your impact. The game is full of information you can use in the real world, combined with a fun, little adventure game on a beautiful lowpoly-island.

I hope you have fun and learn something, while playing my game. If you have any questions, or you found bugs in my game (add a screenshot), please write an email to Leon.d.koehler@gmail.com

## How to play:    
To find all aspects of the game, the user needs to move the player to every location. To do this, just click on the player and then on the white spots, which show possible movements in the current turn. If you have moved your player, please click the turn button in the bottom left corner. This will start the next turn and allows you to move the player further around the map. With stars (the currency of Oceanio) you can positively change the ocean (more on that in the following lines). 
### The goal of the game is to free up the ocean off plastic and the algae bloom cause, and to build a beautiful marine ecosystem.

- ### Remove Plastic:                     
  Move the player to a water-tile with plastic. On the bottom-right corner you will see a button. If you have at least 2 Stars (you can see your Star-Amount in the upper-left corner) you can click the button and remove the plastic from the water. Now you have created the perfect conditions for fish to thrive.
  
- ### Remove Algae Bloom:                 
  To stop the algae from spreading, find the cause of the problem by moving the player around the map. If you find the cause, just click on the green circle to remove the algae bloom source. 
  
- ### Populate water with fish:                                 
  To populate the ocean, the player needs to stand on a water tile (without algae or plastic) and have at least 3 Stars. If this is the case, a button will be available (bottom right corner) to populate the water tile with fish.
  
- ### Populate water with coral reef:                 
  Coral reefs produce one star every turn, so they are crucial for making any progress in the game. To create the perfect conditions for coral reefs, just stand on a fish tile and have at least 5 Stars. Now, again with a button, you can create the coral reefs.
