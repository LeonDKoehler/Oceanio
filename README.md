Thank you for trying out my game Oceanio. It is designed to give you a better understanding about current, human-made impacts on our oceans and how you can reduce your impact. The game is full of information you can use in the real world, combined with a fun, little adventure in a beautiful lowpoly-island world.

I hope you have fun and learn something, while playing my game. If you have any questions, or you found bugs in my game (add a screenshot), please write an email to Leondakoe@gmail.com
